          <p>D2N2 is the Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) for Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.</p>

<p>Local Enterprise Partnerships are private sector-led, locally-owned partnerships between business, local authorities, skills and training providers, and community and voluntary organisations. There are 39 LEPs in England.</p>

<p>They play a central role in deciding local economic priorities and undertaking activities to drive economic growth and create local jobs.</p>

<p>D2N2, established in 2010, is one of the largest LEPs in England, covering an area with a population of more than two million people and with an economic output of over £41.2billion (ONS report, February 2015).
Its Chief Executive is David Ralph and its Chairman Peter Richardson.</p>

<p>D2N2’s target is to support the creation of 55,000 new jobs in D2N2 by 2023. The majority of these jobs will be in the private sector.</p>

<p>Its vision is of a more prosperous, better connected, and increasingly resilient and competitive economy.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to support and encourage economic growth in the D2N2 region.</p>
